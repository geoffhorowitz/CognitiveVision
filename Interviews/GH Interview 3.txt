Business School (Classroom)

Walks out of classroom, can turn left or right.  On left is hallway that appears to open up to large area
On right is another hallway, ends at windows with an intersection to another hallway

D1: decides to turn left
--> reaches end of hall, large area is just classrooms and fire-escape stairs.
--> subject decides bathrooms are not in this area from visual search, turns around and heads back toward starting position

Ends up making equivalent of right turn from starting position, heads towards windows

D2: at windows, option to turn left or right.  Subject sees that left turn dead-ends, so turns right

Walks down hallway which opens up toward large staircase.

before reaching large open staircase/area, subject reaches intersection, looks down intersection,
-->notices water fountains, so decides to turn down that hallway
(GH Note: there was also a sign that pointed to bathrooms down this hallway, but it was in the opposite direction from subject walking -- he did not see sign).
--> bathrooms are further down on left
