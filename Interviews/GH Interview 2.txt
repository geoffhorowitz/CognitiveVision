Business School (Auditorium)

Decision 1:
Walked out of classroom (because no bathroom in classroom), 

D2:
only way to turn is left - therefore turn left

D3: Can see doors (& exit signs), but its clear that doors lead directly outside, not to bathroom, so ignores doors
--> sees common area straight ahead, wants to head to common area to look for signs leading to bathroom
-->heads toward common area

D4:
In common area, sees signs in all different directions, starts reading signs
--> sees one sign that points toward restrooms
--> follows signs to restrooms

(GH notices water fountains on left - subject ignores them)
keeps walking down hallway --> sign for mens room on right
