Subject started in lab room.

Decision 1:
	subject left lab room.  Knew bathroom was not in room (from knowledge of building layouts) and had to leave room to find bathroom.
	Only place to exit was through door - exited through door

Decision 2:
	once outside door, subject had option to turn left (toward open lab area) or turn right (toward hallway)
	Turned right because assumed bathroom would be closer to exit than further in building nearer a lab (saw exit sign)

Decision 3:
	hallway dead-ended - could turn left (down another hallway with labs on either side, at far end, was another hallway with right angle turn
				or right (toward common area of floor, exit signs, etc)
	decided to turn right because bathrooms were generally in a centralized area near the middle of the building

Decision 4:
	before reaching the common area, another hallway was split off on the left
	after looking down that hallway, subject saw water fountains on wall
	turned down that hallway because subject knew water fountains were often found near bathroom

Decision 5:
	as subject walked down hallway, saw bathrooms on left hand side of the hallway (men's bathroom sign) - entered bathroom.
